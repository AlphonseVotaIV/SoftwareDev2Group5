#Starting Localhost

To start your localhost up for the website, do this step-by-step guide in order to get it working:

1. Open up a terminal in the "Terminal" drop-down menu, and create a new instance

2. In the terminal, type "cd Stinger-Website" to bring yourself into the internals, then type "cd website" to bring yourself to the server.js file location

3. Type "node server.js" and hit enter to get the website running on localhost.

4. Then, go to a webpage and type in your URL bar "localhost:3000", and you will load up the website on a webpage!

When you want to refresh the website on localhost, go back to the terminal, hit Ctrl+C, hit the UP arrow, and hit enter, 
this would refresh the localhost instance, and update the webpage.
