# SoftwareDev2Group5
For the first assignment, we created a sample page
of what a blog page looks like. We created posts and
and put in an icon to make the website look more neat.

For the second assignment, we added more pages, connected
them using a navigation bar, and set up a localhost for the 
website.

For the third assignment, we started to revamp the look of the website, brought EJS into making our pages look more dynamic, and reworked our internals to set ourselves up for success.  While there have been some flounders in our setup and lack of certain functionality, we are aiming to bring the website close to where it was promised.
